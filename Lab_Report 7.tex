 \textbf {Objective}\\ The objective of this session is to show the representation of graphs using C++. 
 
 \textbf {Software Tool} \\
 1. Code Blocks with GCC compiler.

\section{Theory }              

Graph is a data structure that consists of following two components:
1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not same as (v, u) in case of directed graph(di-graph). The pair of form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.


Adjacency Matrix:
Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph. Let the 2D array be adj[][], a slot adj[i][j] = 1 indicates that there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j. Adjacency matrix for undirected graph is always symmetric. Adjacency Matrix is also used to represent weighted graphs. If adj[i][j] = w, then there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j with weight w.

\section{Task}  

\subsection{ Task 1 }     


Write a C++ code using functions for the following operations. 
 
1. 
add adges in the adjacent matrix. 
2. 
Display the added Edges.

 

\subsection{Procedure: Task 1 }    
 

\begin{lstlisting}

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
void addEdge(vector<int> adj[], int u, int v)
{
    adj[u].push_back(v);
    adj[v].push_back(u);
}
 
void printGraph(vector<int> adj[], int V)
{
    for (int v = 0; v < V; ++v)
    {
        cout << "\n Adjacency list of vertex "
             << v << "\n head ";
        for (int auto x : adj[v])
           cout << "-> " <<x;
        cout<<"\n";
    }
}
 
int main()
{
    int V = 5;
    vector<int> adj[V];
    addEdge(adj, 0, 1);
    addEdge(adj, 0, 4);
    addEdge(adj, 1, 2);
    addEdge(adj, 1, 3);
    addEdge(adj, 1, 4);
    addEdge(adj, 2, 3);
    addEdge(adj, 3, 4);
    printGraph(adj, V);
    return 0;
