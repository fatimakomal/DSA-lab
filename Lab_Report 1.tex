 \textbf {Objective}\\ The objectives of this lab session are to understand the basic and various operations on arrays in C++.
 
 \textbf {Software Tool} \\
 1. Code Blocks with GCC compiler.

\section{Theory }              

We have already studied array in our computer programming course. We would be using the knowledge we learned there to implement different operation on arrays.

Traversing Linear Arrays:-

Let A be the collection of data elements stored in the memory of the computer. Suppose we want to print the contents of each element of A or suppose we want to count the number of elements of A with a given property. This can be accomplished by traversing A that is by accessing and Processing each element of A exactly once.

The following algorithm traverses a linear array. The simplicity of the algorithm comes from the fact that LA is a linear structure. Other linear structures such as linked list can also be easily traversed. On the other hand the traversal of non-linear structures such as trees and graphs is considerably more complicated.
